# Workshop-4-Ajax-JSON

The purpose of this workshop is to write a fully functional frontend app  for catalogging books using REST API.

First part of this project is a pre-configured REST server written in Java using Jersey, which I modified for my purposes a bit, and the second one is a client which I wrote in HTML, JavaScript and jQuery, which communicates with the server using Ajax and JSON.

User can freely add/delete/edit books that are on the list, and also reset the list to its  initial state.
